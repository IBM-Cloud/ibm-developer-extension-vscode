# IBM Developer Extension for VS Code

This extension provides capabilities for the IBM [developer cli](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cloudnative/dev_cli.html) from directly within the VS Code editor.   Use the VS Code command palette to quickly access all `bx dev` commands, without the need to leave the editor's context.

## Changelog

  - Added `bx dev console` command
  - Added check for hostname and domain in cli-config.yml for CF deployment (no longer required when project is created)
- *v0.0.13* 
  - Updated IBM Cloud icon
- *v0.0.12* 
  - Added support for `bx dev shell` command
  - Removed support for the `sdkgen` cli
  - Improved cli version detection with minimum versioning and forced upgrade paths to support new cli features
  - Added support for "caller" arguments for the `dev` cli
- *v0.0.11* 
  - Added support for Kubernetes/Helm deployment
  - Added support for `bx dev console`
- *v0.0.10* 
  - Updated badges in README for VS Code marketplace compliance.  
  - Fixed "killed terminal" bug in login/logout commands
- *v0.0.9* - Updated usage/getting started in README
- *v0.0.8* - first public release

## Usage

Easily invoke commands from the IBM Bluemix Developer CLI from directly inside of the VS Code editor:

- Open the VS Code command pallette (`F1` or `CMD-Shift-P`)
- Use the `bx login` command to log in to Bluemix (using your Bluemix credentials)

### Using `bx dev` workflow: 
Video demonstrating `bx dev` workflow: [IBM Developer Extension for VS Code
](https://youtu.be/JmrLaLRRQSk)

Steps to get started:
- Create a project using one of the two methods below:
    - `bx dev create` using the Bluemix Developer CLI (outside of VS Code)
    - [Bluemix Web console](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/developer/getting-started/)
- Open the *project’s folder* locally in the VS Code editor
- Use the `bx dev build` command to build the app into a Docker image
- Use the `bx dev debug` command to run the app in local Docker for development
- Use the `bx dev run` command to run the app in local Docker in release mode
- Use the `bx dev deploy` command to deploy the app (in the Docker container) to Bluemix
- Use the `bx dev console` command to open your project on Bluemix in a web browser

### Using CloudFoundry workflow: 
Video demonstrating `CloudFoundry` workflow: [IBM Developer Extension for VS Code for CloudFoundry
](https://youtu.be/gP_6cpR1JSM)

Steps to get started:
- Create a new CloudFoundry application
    - Use the [web console](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/cf-apps) and download the starter code
    - Create a new CloudFoundry app manually
- Open the *project’s folder* locally in the VS Code editor
- Use `bx cf apps` to list all of your apps
- Use `bx cf push` to push a build of your app
- Use `bx cf <start/stop/restage/restart>` to change the status of your app
- Use `bx cf logs` to view the live log stream for your app
  - _Use `bx cf logs` to stop the log stream_

### Supported CLI/plugins:

- `bx login/logout` - Bluemix user authentication
- `bx dev` - Bluemix developer CLI
- `bx cf` - Bluemix CloudFoundry CLI
- `bx cs` - Bluemix Container Service CLI
- `bx sdk` - Bluemix SDK Generation CLI

## Requirements/Dependencies

* [Bluemix CLI](https://plugins.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html)
* Bluemix `dev` cli plugin   
    After installing the Bluemix CLI, open up a terminal and run `bx plugin install dev -r Bluemix`
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - required by `bx dev` containers



## Debugging Node.js apps within the local Docker container

First, make sure your app is running inside of a local container using `bx dev debug`. _Note: `debug` action requires prior `bx dev build --debug` action)_

Next, You have to create a launch configuration inside of `.vscode/launch.json`.   If you don't already have a `launch.json` file, go to the `Debug` -> `Add Configuration` menu and paste the following into the `configurations` array.  The default debug port is `9229` and the default remoteRoot is `/app/`:

```
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "Attach to Local Container",
    "address": "localhost",
    "port": 9229,
    "localRoot": "${workspaceRoot}/",
    "remoteRoot": "/app/"
}
```
